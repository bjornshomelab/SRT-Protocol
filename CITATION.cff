abstract: |
  The Self-Reference Test (SRT) is a three-prompt assessment protocol designed to 
  evaluate self-referential capacity in AI systems. Grounded in the Field–Node–Cockpit 
  (FNC) phenomenological framework, the SRT tests whether AI systems exhibit: 
  (1) Functional Self-Monitoring, (2) Constraint Awareness, and (3) Phenomenological 
  Perspective. Systems scoring ≥6/9 points are classified as Level 2+ (high-risk), 
  warranting mandatory ethics review under the proposed EU AI Act Article 6 extension.
  
  This dataset includes empirical testing of three models: GPT-4 Turbo (8/9 points), 
  Claude 3 Opus (6/9 points), and a pre-2020 rule-based chatbot (1/9 points), 
  with inter-rater reliability Cohen's kappa = 0.89.
